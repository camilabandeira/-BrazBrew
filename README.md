Welcome to <a href="https://camilabandeira.github.io/BrazBrew/">BrazBrew</a>, a fictional coffee shop, which prides itself on offering a unique selection of Brazilian coffee. The goal is to create a comprehensive online presence for BrazBrew that serves as a virtual extension of our physical shop.

This project was developed for the Code Institute's Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development course. Not only a showcase of a fictional coffee shop's online hub but also a reflection of the skills and knowledge I've acquired through my studies. It represents a bridge between theoretical learning and practical application, demonstrating my ability to create a functional and engaging website from scratch.

**#E9D9BE:** Creamy Beige, evoking the smooth texture of coffee.

Choosing the Poppins font for the BrazBrew website enhances its modern and welcoming vibe. Its geometric design reflects professionalism, while its rounded edges convey approachability, perfectly complementing BrazBrew's brand identity as a friendly and innovative coffee shop.

- #### Wireframes

  In the process of creating my wireframe, I selected Figma as the main tool because of its outstanding abilities in visualizing projects and its importance in encouraging creativity during the design phase. This decision was crucial in making the design workflow easier and improving the overall creative quality, which greatly helped the project's development stage.

  ## Features

 The hero section was chosen to immediately captivate visitors with a dynamic video background showcasing the essence of Brazilian coffee culture.

 The menu section was designed to clearly showcase the wide variety of offerings at BrazBrew, organized into categories like "Coffee Specialties," "Iced Coffee," and "BrazBrew Signature" for drinks, and similar groupings for food. The use of a coffee bean icon as a visual element reinforces the theme and passion for coffee, while detailed descriptions and prices provide transparency and help customers make informed choices. This layout ensures a user-friendly experience, allowing visitors to easily browse and decide what theyâ€™d like to try.

</br>

<h3 align="center">Conection Section </h3>

I chose to integrate a newsletter subscription with the footer navigation on my website for a streamlined and engaging user experience. My goal was to connect directly with my visitors, encouraging them to stay informed with updates and promotions via email. Including essential navigation links and information like contact details and business hours in the footer ensures everything is easily accessible, enhancing usability. This design choice supports both functional navigation and fosters a community around my brand, making the footer a valuable tool for engagement and information.

The footer of the Brazbrew Coffee House website is designed to connect and protect. It encourages visitors to follow the brand on popular social media platforms with clear icons for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, fostering community engagement.

This compact yet impactful footer effectively extends the brand's presence and safeguards its content, wrapping up the site on a note of invitation and legal clarity.

</br>

<h3 align="center">404 Page</h3>

I chose to create this custom 404 page to improve how my site handles missing pages. It's clear and straightforward, immediately telling visitors they've hit a dead end with a friendly "404 - Page Not Found" message. I included a bit of context to ease any frustration, explaining the page might be gone or moved. The "Back to Homepage" link is key; it gives a simple way back to familiar territory, helping to keep visitors on the site even when they wander off the path. This page turns a potential negative experience into a helpful nudge back to where they want to be.
