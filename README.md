Welcome to <a href="https://camilabandeira.github.io/BrazBrew/">BrazBrew</a>, a fictional coffee shop, which prides itself on offering a unique selection of Brazilian coffee. The goal is to create a comprehensive online presence for BrazBrew that serves as a virtual extension of our physical shop.

This project was developed for the Code Institute's Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development course. Not only a showcase of a fictional coffee shop's online hub but also a reflection of the skills and knowledge I've acquired through my studies. It represents a bridge between theoretical learning and practical application, demonstrating my ability to create a functional and engaging website from scratch.

Choosing the Poppins font for the BrazBrew website enhances its modern and welcoming vibe. Its geometric design reflects professionalism, while its rounded edges convey approachability, perfectly complementing BrazBrew's brand identity as a friendly and innovative coffee shop.

- #### Wireframes

  In the process of creating my wireframe, I selected Figma as the main tool because of its outstanding abilities in visualizing projects and its importance in encouraging creativity during the design phase. This decision was crucial in making the design workflow easier and improving the overall creative quality, which greatly helped the project's development stage.
