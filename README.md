<h1 align="center"> BrazBrew Website - Code Institute Project 1</h1>

Welcome to <a href="https://camilabandeira.github.io/BrazBrew/">BrazBrew</a>, a project developed for the Code Institute's Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development course. This projet brings to life a fictional coffee shop, BrazBrew, which prides itself on offering a unique selection of Brazilian coffee. The goal is to create a comprehensive online presence for BrazBrew that serves as a virtual extension of our physical shop.

Through our website, customers will be able to:

- Explore Our Extensive Drink Menu: Delve into detailed descriptions of our coffee offerings and prices. Whether you're in the mood for a classic espresso or something more exotic, our menu is designed to cater to your preferences, with alternatives for milk and sweeteners available.
- Discover Our Story: Journey through the origins of BrazBrew, from our humble beginnings to our passion for Brazilian coffee.
- Locate Us: Find comprehensive details about our location, including a map.
- Get in Touch: Invite you to reach out with any inquiries, feedback, or just to say hello. The website features a user-friendly contact form with direct email. Whether you're interested in learning more about our coffee, planning an event, or sharing your BrazBrew experience.
- Newsletter sign-up: Offers customers the opportunity to stay connected with BrazBrew.

This project is not only a showcase of a fictional coffee shop's online hub but also a reflection of the skills and knowledge I've acquired through my studies. It represents a bridge between theoretical learning and practical application, demonstrating my ability to create a functional and engaging website from scratch.
